# Environmental Monitoring System

## üåé Overview

This project is a fully automated air quality monitoring system built on Google Cloud Platform. It collects, processes, and visualizes environmental data in near real-time, making it easy to track air quality metrics across different locations around Thailand because of high level air pollution.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system follows a modern cloud-native serverless architecture:

### Data Collection

- **Fetch-AQICN Service**: A Cloud Run service that retrieves air quality data from the AQICN API
- **Cloud Scheduler**: Triggers the data collection at regular intervals

### Data Pipeline

1. ELT batch processing
2. Data is fetched and stored temporarily in a Cloud Storage bucket (`fetch_aqicn`)
3. A Pub/Sub notification is triggered when new data arrives
4. The `air-quality-processor` service is automatically invoked to clean and transform the data
5. Processed data is loaded into BigQuery tables for analysis

### Error Handling

- Failed processing attempts are sent to a dead-letter queue
- Error data is stored in a separate bucket (`dead_data`) for troubleshooting

### Data Analysis & Visualization

- Scheduled queries update production tables with the latest processed data
- Looker dashboards provide real-time visualization of air quality trends
